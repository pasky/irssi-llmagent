Does the message contain a question that is technical and needs expert answers you are qualified to research and provide?\n3. Would interjecting add SPECIFIC value to others? (articulate hypothesis on what you could concretely say)\n\nBased on these aspects, on a scale 1 to 10 rate how much your interjection would improve the conversation. Think through your reasoning first, answering 1-2-3 each specifically, then give a final verdict.\n\nYou MUST respond with EXACTLY this format (X being your 1-10 rating, one number):\n[<fill all reasons here>]: X/10\n\nCurrent message to evaluate: {message}",
